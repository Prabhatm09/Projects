                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written 
                    in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
                    css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
